The number one usecase to address here was screen rotation. Since when a screen would be rotated (or otherwise resized), the subviews in the screen would most likely hold an incorrect frame (position and size) in the newly sized superview. To address this, Apple introduced a series of enumerable properties (called Autoresizing Masks), that tell the superview to treat a subview in a particular way. Among these are",
